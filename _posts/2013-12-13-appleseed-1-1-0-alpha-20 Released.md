title: appleseed 1.1.0 alpha-20 Released
---
We just released **appleseed 1.1.0 alpha-20**.


The major feature of this new release is a new lighting engine based on the Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping (SPPM) algorithm. It works pretty well in itself and allows to efficiently render caustics-heavy scenes. It is also an important stepping stone toward the implementation of Vertex Connection and Merging (VCM), a modern, all-encompassing bidirectional light transport algorithm.


New features also include multipass rendering, a new spherical camera model to render latitude-longitude environment maps, fractional sample counts for direct and image-based lighting, etc.


Check the release notes for the full list of changes.
